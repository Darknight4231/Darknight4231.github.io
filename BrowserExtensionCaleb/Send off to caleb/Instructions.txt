To utilize this,

1: Unzip folder wherever you'd like it to sit. (Doesn't matter where to my knowledge).
2: Open browser
3: Find  "Manage Extensions" > Load Unpacked > Select the "Speedy Extension" folder wherever you unzipped it.
4: Set a speed using the popup. This will load and run through any time a tab changes, is activated, opened, created, updated.



**CAUTION**
When changing speed using the popup, give the extension a few moments before proceeding to change the value again. It filters through all DOM elements on ALL web pages, so it might take it a moment. Changing before it finishes its process will simply halt playback of ALL videos.
***********


**NOTE**
This HAS to have some kind of adblocker -- it doesn't currently work when Youtube videos load iframes over the main video, and resets its own playspeed. With uBlocker, this isn't an issue.
