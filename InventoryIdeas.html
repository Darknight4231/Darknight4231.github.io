I want to make an inventory system for a video game -- I want to press TAB and pull up a grid-like menu, and use arrow keys or WASD to select different items. <br/>

*Pulling up a menu by pressing TAB (normally wouldn't be an issue, but my laptop doesn't read the keyCode -- it's always undefined for me (WTF??))<br/>

*****************<br/>
CAN NOW READ KEYCODE VALUES<br/>
*****************<br/>

*WASD or arrow keys to change selection might be an issue, as I don't really know a good way of making a grid.. Kramer's Law? (I just mean to use matrices -- maybe?)<br/>

<script>


     const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
     const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

     //this chooses the canvas "myCanvas" and makes it take up the same space as the window does. dunno about resizing updates.. ****Resizing does not work--whatever the window size is when loaded, is what you get.
     const cramw = myCanvas.width = window.innerWidth;
     const cramh = myCanvas.height = window.innerHeight;


     document.addEventListener("keydown", keyDownHandler, false);

     function keyDownHandler(e){
       switch (e.keyCode) {
         case 9:
           console.log("TAB was pressed");
           break;
         default:

       }
       console.log(e.key+" "+ e.keyCode);
       ctx.clearRect(0,0,cramw,cramh);
       ctx.fillText(`${e.key}` +" " + `${e.keyCode}`, cramw/2,cramh/2);
     }
</script>
