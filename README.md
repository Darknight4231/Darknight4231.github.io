This README is for anyone curious enough to have found me or perhaps someone I know.


This webpage is for development of games, testing of ideas any may have, and hopefully getting better feedback/learning faster, becoming better, getting stronger.



Currently, I have an interactive JS animation. It shows raindrops (blue-ish squares) falling. Clicking anywhere on screen creates a new raindrop.
There currently isn't a limit on the drops.
Works on mobile/desktop.
Resizing keeps the screen size, you'd need to reload the page.



Hoping to remake my favorite game--Fishy. You play as a fish who eats other fish. Fish bigger than you eat you. you get bigger based off of the size of the fish you eat.
There are levels, you only have so many fish you are allowed to eat before all fish get bigger--if you keep eating small stuff you'll stay small.
