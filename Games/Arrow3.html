    This is a wonderful little project I'm working on. Hopefully one day you can actually do something in it. For now, though.. <br/><br/>
    It shoots (soon to be) arrows with care to showcase gravity, and (X,Y) values of clicks.
    FOR ME
    go here <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Collision_detection">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Collision_detection</a>
    </p>

   <ul>
   <li>clicking anywhere shoots an arrow relative to mouse placement.</li>
   </ul>

   <ol>
   <li><s>Next up need to fix so the mouse is read from inside the canvas, not from the friggin window.. or is it reading from the client screen.. idk atm..</s>
   <li>I want to make it so the arrows angle.. gonna need to review translations. UGH hahahaa
   <li>Gotta add more to the arrows.Arrow head, a tail/feather or whatev.  it'd be neat to have a trail on each/last fired arrow.
   <li><s>Add X values for sure, to change arrow speed and of course allow clicking anywhere inside the canvas (not the dang window itself!)</s>
   <li>These are NOT currently in order, and even if they were 'Order subject to change' ;D </li>
   </ol>
