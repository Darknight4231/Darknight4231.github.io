    This is a wonderful little project I'm working on. Hopefully one day you can actually do something in it. For now, though.. <br/><br/>
    It shoots (soon to be) arrows with care to showcase gravity and Y value of clicks.
 
   <ul>
   <li>There is a red square that shows where the arrow is fired from
   <li>the blue line shows a level shooting field
   <li>clicking anywhere in the yellowish column shoots an arrow relative to mouse placement.</li>
   </ul>
  
   <ol>
   <li>Next up need to fix so the mouse is read from inside the canvas, not from the friggin window.. or is it reading from the client screen.. idk atm..
   <li>I want to make it so the arrows angle.. gonna need to review translations. UGH hahahaa
   <li>Gotta add more to the arrows.Arrow head, a tail/feather or whatev.  it'd be neat to have a trail on each/last fired arrow.
   <li>Add X values for sure, to change arrow speed and of course allow clicking anywhere inside the canvas (not the dang window itself!)
   <li>These are NOT currently in order, and even if they were-- 'Order subject to change' ;D </li>
    </ol>
    </ul>
