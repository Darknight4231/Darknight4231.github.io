According to the Wikipedia article about voice frequency: "The voiced speech of a typical adult male will have a fundamental frequency from 85 to 180 Hz, and that of a typical adult female from 165 to 255 Hz." That is, the frequency ranges (of the fundamental frequency) are about an octave apart, for males and females.
