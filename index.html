   Hey guys<a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/"> this </a>is a pretty good site if anyone wants to know more about circuitry. <a href = "https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/"> Here's</a> a HL to chapter one. Direct Current.


Aand here's a full list of the Canvas element in JS.
<a href ="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html"> Here.</a>
And <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/">Here</a> is a link to learn more about audio nodes, how to utilize the web audio API.

  <a href="http://www.echoecho.com/">This</a> is the website that showed me how to make links
	And <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">this</a> checks HTML to make sure everything is where it's supposed to be--it also tells what's wrong and where.

 This is another link, one that I've been using much more frequently. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Developer.mozilla</a>
